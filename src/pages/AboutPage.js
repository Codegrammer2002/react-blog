        <h1> Some general questions about the blog</h1>
        <h2>What's this blog about?</h2>
        <p> This a blog that I created using the MERN stack. It has some sample articles. Feel free to read those! and add your comments </p>
        <p> It's one of the first projects that I developed using React.js</p>
        <h2> Why does it look simple? </h2>
        <p> I wanted to stick with the basics for this project that's why there isn't a lot of CSS. It's project to showcase my 
            full-stack webapp development skills. I plan to develop a few more projects for my portfolio and one of them will be a much better and upgraded version of this blog. So, stay tuned!
        </p>
        <h2> What can I find on this blog?  </h2>
            <p> There isn't a lot of content as of now. This is more of a portfolio project. I have two brief articles about learning articles and passing german exam. Fell free to take a look at them.
                You can comment and upvote the articles! There are two more which I need to write and I'll write them soon. 
            </p>
