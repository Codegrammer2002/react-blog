            `I wrote about it on Quora 4 years ago when I was 15 and passed my B1 exam with 92.5%. I think that the advice I gave is still relevant so I am just going to copy what I wrote.
            Passing the  German B1 exam is one of the crucial steps to studying or working in Germany as it is the minimum level required. But it is not that difficult! With proper guidance and practice, one can clear B1 with flying colors. I am mentioning here some tips and books which I used to clear my B1 with 92.5%`,

            `Practice all 4 parts every day which include:`,
            
            `1. Lesen 2. Schreiben 3. Hören 4. Sprechen`,
            
            `25 minutes of reading every day should be enough. Same with the other 3 parts. Practice German in a group of 2–3 people (if you are enrolled in an institute). If not then find a language partner to practice German(this is really important to gain fluency in the language.`,

            `Prüfungstraining B1 and Fit fürs (B1 Goethe Zertifikat) this three books are enough for clearing B1 with good numbers.`,
            
             `Don't lose hope if you feel stuck just think of the reason behind you started learning German.
            
              And the most important thing is don't learn german just to clear the exam, learn German to speak German. I know this is a bit controversial but learning German just for clearing the exam will not work trust me. To learn German to speak German.`,
